# Document Manager
Document Manager is a full stack document management system, complete with roles and privileges . Each document defines access rights; the document defines which roles can access it. Also, each document specifies the date it was published.
Users are categorized by roles. Users with access to specific documents can edit and update their documents but will not be granted access to read or write to a document with unathourized access role, only a view access.

## Features

1. **Authentication**
  - It uses JWT for authentication.  
  - It generates and returns a token on successful login or creation of a user.
  - It saves users tokens to be used to manage sessions  
  - It verifies the token on every request to authenticated endpoints.

2. **Users**
  - It allows creation of new users. 
  - It ensures no other user can be assigned the admin role (there are only two admin roles)
  - It sets a newly created user's role category to `regular` by default.  
  - It allows created user to edit/update their information.
  - Only the admin user can update/edit other users information.
  - All registered users can be retrieved by the admin user or other registered users (it doesn't return sensitive information(passwords, tokens) of the users retrieved).

3. **Roles**
  - It makes sure  that created users have a role defined.
  - It ensures new roles can be created, updated and deleted by only the admin user.   
  - It does not currently allow the admin user carry out CRUD operations on the roles but that could be easily enabled.

4. **Documents**
  - It allows new documents to be created/saved by users.  
  - It ensures all documents have an access type defined (default access type is `public`).  
  - It allows only admin users retrieve all documents regardless of the document required access type.  
  - It ensures document retrieval by their owners, public access typed documents can be retrieved by all users and role access typed documents can be retrieved by ONLY users with the same role level as the document owner.     
  - It ensures only authenticated users can delete, edit and update documents they own and users cannot delete documents they do not own (with the exception of the admin). 

## Limitations
1. Users can only create plain textual documents and retrieve same when needed.
2. Users cannot share documents with people, but can make document public or role to make it available to other users.
3. Admin cannot temporarily block a user.
4. Users login and obtain a token which is verified on every request, but users cannot logout (nullify the token), however tokens become invalid when it expires.
